# Hell Triangle - Challenge

Given a triangle of numbers, find the maximum total from top to bottom

Example:

[6] 

[3 , 5]

[9 , 7 , 1 ]

[4 , 6 , 8 , 4]  

In this triangle the maximum total is 6+5+7+8=26

An element can only be summed with one of the two nearest elements in the next row So the element 3 in row 2 can be summed with 9 and 7, but not with 1

Choose the programming language you want... let us know about why is that your choice Besides the solution itself, write an automated test for your code (using a known framework or just another function/method)

Your code will receive an (multidimensional) array as input. The triangle from above would be: example = [[6],[3,5],[9,7,1],[4,6,8,4]]

# Consideration

- Java language was chosen because I have most experience and so I can show my best knowledge not only in solving the problem as well as in quality of code and design.

- There is a class main in src/java/br/com/challenge/helltriangle/main  where It's possible run the program.
